# ColorCode

### Hey There.! I am Sudeep Nellur back with another pet project after decade of procrastination(startup guy:cry:) called as *ColorCode*. This is a web app where you will upload an image and it will give you the color palette so that you don't have to stretch your head for the HEX code or RBG code of your favorite color out of the images you just saw.

Q) Now why it is used and who can benefit out of it?<br/>
A) Anyone in the industry like UX/UI designer, Frontend developer, Photographer/Videographer, Fashion designer and folks in architecture.

Let's talk about the tech stack of the app.

The App got a **Clustering ML algorithm** that will create the clusters for all similar colors and using the centroid of each cluster we can fetch the HEX and RGB code. Then this app is exposed as APIs where it can be connected to the frontend later and here I have gone with **Flask** as the RestAPI framework. The visualization is taken care of via **Bootstrap** and the user will be using the app via this. To make it production-grade ready I have added a WSGI server using the **Gunicorn**. To finish it up all neat and good I have containerized the app by creating the **Docker** Image and this is simply made live **Heroku** cloud server.
